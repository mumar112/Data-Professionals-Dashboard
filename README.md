I am excited to a share the data professional survey dashboard I just completed in Power BI.
Based on my visualization:
-         Data scientists earn the most in the data professional field.
-         Python Is the most used programming language by data professionals.
-         There are about 630 survey takers.
-         The average age for the survey was 30 years old.
-         Most people are not too happy with their salaries.
-         More people are Happy with work/life balance.
